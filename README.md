# Sherbet #

This is really new and hopefully will become something cool. For now all you can do is live CSS updating in the browser. Pass a JSON file to `sherbet` with `-json` which will be used for the server config. Otherwise it just looks for a `sherbet.json` in the same directory. Look at `./web/example/sherbet.json` for an example.
