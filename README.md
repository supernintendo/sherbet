# Sherbet #

Sherbet watches files for changes and sends WebSocket messages to a client which acts as a wrapper for your web app. This allows you to do live CSS reloading and trigger other events.

### Ooh, really?!

Well, it's still very new and not in much of a usable state! You can build it with `build.sh` and run it with `./sherbet`. Use `-j` to pass in a JSON file to use for your configuration. Otherwise, Sherbet will load `sherbet.json` from the relative directory.

### I'm confused...

Me too.
